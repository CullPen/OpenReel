# Basic Video Recommendation Engine

This project implements a simple video recommendation algorithm based on shared tags between videos a user has interacted with and other available videos.

## Functionality

The core of this project is the `recommend_videos` function, which suggests videos to a user based on their viewing history.

### `recommend_videos(user_history, all_videos, num_recommendations=3)`

This function takes the user's video interaction history and a catalog of all available videos to generate recommendations.

**Arguments:**

*   `user_history` (list): A list of video IDs the user has interacted with (e.g., watched, liked).
*   `all_videos` (dict): A dictionary where keys are video IDs and values are dictionaries containing video information, including `'tags'`.
    ```python
    {
        "video1": {"title": "Funny Cats", "tags": ["cats", "funny", "animals"]},
        "video2": {"title": "Coding Tutorial", "tags": ["coding", "tutorial", "python"]},
        "video3": {"title": "More Cats!", "tags": ["cats", "cute", "animals"]}
    }
    ```
*   `num_recommendations` (int, optional): The number of videos to recommend. Defaults to `3`.

**Returns:**

*   `list`: A list of recommended video IDs.

## Example Usage

```python
from your_module import recommend_videos  # Assuming the function is in 'your_module.py'

all_videos_data = {
    "video1": {"title": "Funny Cats", "tags": ["cats", "funny", "animals"]},
    "video2": {"title": "Coding Tutorial", "tags": ["coding", "tutorial", "python"]},
    "video3": {"title": "More Cats!", "tags": ["cats", "cute", "animals"]},
    "video4": {"title": "Python Basics", "tags": ["coding", "python", "beginner"]},
    "video5": {"title": "Dog Tricks", "tags": ["dogs", "training", "animals"]},
    "video6": {"title": "Advanced Python", "tags": ["coding", "python", "advanced"]},
}

user_history_data = ["video1", "video3"]  # User has watched "Funny Cats" and "More Cats!"

recommendations = recommend_videos(user_history_data, all_videos_data)
print(f"Recommended videos for the user: {recommendations}")

user_history_empty = []
recommendations_empty_history = recommend_videos(user_history_empty, all_videos_data)
print(f"Recommended videos for a new user: {recommendations_empty_history}")
```

## Explanation of the Algorithm

The `recommend_videos` function implements a basic content-based filtering approach:

1. **Identify User Interests:** It analyzes the `user_history` to extract tags from the videos the user has previously interacted with. These tags represent the user's interests.

2. **Score Other Videos:** It iterates through all the videos in `all_videos` that the user hasn't seen yet. For each of these videos, it calculates a score based on the number of tags it shares with the user's identified interests.

3. **Sort Videos by Score:** The videos are then sorted in descending order based on their calculated scores. Videos with more shared tags rank higher.

4. **Return Top Recommendations:** Finally, the function returns the top `num_recommendations` videos from the sorted list as recommendations.

5. **Handling New Users:** If the `user_history` is empty, the function defaults to recommending the first few videos in the `all_videos` dictionary. This is a very basic approach to handle the "cold start" problem.

## Limitations of this Basic Algorithm

This implementation provides a foundational understanding of recommendation algorithms but has several limitations:

*   **Oversimplification of User Interests:** It solely relies on the presence of shared tags and doesn't consider the importance or context of those tags. Real user preferences are more nuanced.
*   **Cold Start Problem:** The strategy for new users (returning the first few videos) is simplistic and doesn't leverage any information about overall video popularity or trends.
*   **Limited Discovery:** The algorithm primarily recommends videos similar to what the user has already seen, potentially hindering the discovery of new and diverse content outside of their established interests.
*   **Tag Quality and Completeness:** The effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of the video tags. Missing or inaccurate tags will negatively impact recommendations.
*   **Lack of Personalization Beyond History:** It doesn't incorporate other potential factors that could influence recommendations, such as video popularity, user demographics (if available), or the time of interaction.
*   **No Consideration of Tag Weighting:** All tags are treated equally. In reality, some tags might be more indicative of user preference than others.

## Potential Improvements

To enhance the recommendation engine, consider implementing the following improvements:

*   **More Sophisticated Similarity Measures:** Instead of simply counting shared tags, use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh the importance of different tags.
*   **User Profiles:** Create more detailed user profiles that store weighted preferences for different tags or categories.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend videos that users with similar viewing histories have liked. This can help discover new content that aligns with broader user patterns.
*   **Matrix Factorization Techniques:** Explore techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover latent relationships between users and videos.
*   **Machine Learning Models:** Train classification or ranking models using user history and video features to predict the likelihood of a user enjoying a video.
*   **Incorporate Video Attributes:** Include other video attributes like duration, upload date, creator, and view count in the recommendation process.
*   **Implement a Strategy for New Videos:**  Develop a system for recommending new or less-seen videos to promote content discovery.
*   **Implement A/B Testing:**  Test different recommendation strategies to evaluate their effectiveness and make data-driven improvements.
*   **Consider Negative Feedback:** Allow users to express dislike or disinterest in recommendations to refine future suggestions.

This basic example serves as a starting point for building a video recommendation system. By incorporating more advanced techniques, you can create a more personalized and engaging experience for users.
